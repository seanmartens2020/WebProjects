### - Network Topology Simulator and Visualization
Working as team lead for a graduate school project (CS 746 Software Project Management), we were tasked to create a network simulator with visualization capabilities.  On my team were two other graduate students, this project was completed in 2019.  The name 'Cheetah' comes from the randomly assigned team name given to us by our professor.<br/>

### - Government Calendars
Tasked with two public facing calendar apps, I designed and implemented a calendar for the Public Service Commission's events and dockets.  The events app was built to be simple and clean, while the more complex docket app required many more scheduled events plus a subscription service with 2-factor authentication.<br/>
